# Active Context: XLayer Pump.fun Development

## Current Focus
Building a comprehensive pump.fun-style launchpad on X Layer with advanced features to win the $5,000 hackathon prize.

## Immediate Tasks
1. **Smart Contract Development**: Core bonding curve and token factory
2. **Frontend Implementation**: Modern UI with wallet integration
3. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive contract and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Complete setup and deployment guides

## Key Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Factory pattern for token creation
- **Bonding Curve**: Exponential curve with OKB accumulation
- **DEX Integration**: OkieSwap primary, Uniswap v3 fallback
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind
- **Security**: Reentrancy guards, access control, timelocks

## Technical Approach
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across multiple contracts
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient storage and batch operations
- **User Experience**: Intuitive token creation and trading flow
- **Scalability**: Designed for X Layer's 5,000 TPS capability

## Risk Mitigation
- **Security Audits**: Built-in security patterns and testing
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple DEX integration options
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery
- **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions

## Innovation Elements
- **Advanced Bonding Curve**: Optimized for meme token dynamics
- **Anti-Rug Mechanisms**: Time-locked liquidity and gradual unlocks
- **Referral System**: Built-in reward distribution
- **Community Features**: Governance token integration
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for all devices

## Development Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Smart contract framework (2 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Frontend development (3 hours)
- **Phase 3**: Integration and testing (2 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and deployment (1 hour)

## Success Criteria
- Functional token creation and trading
- Successful DEX migration at 80 OKB threshold
- Secure fee distribution mechanism
- Intuitive user interface
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Production-ready deployment scripts
